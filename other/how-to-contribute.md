# How To Contribute

As the Ongaeshi project is a DAO project, we have opened the Gitbook documentation for developers and the community to edit.

(Make sure that the files included in the changes are **MD file format**).

Your changes after merging will be reflected in the public Gitbook.

3. If a new page or group is created, please go to the SUMMARY.md file and edit the file to ensure that the page or group will show up in the GitBook. (Note to view your changes use your own GitBook account and import your changes by syncing GitBook and GitHub)
