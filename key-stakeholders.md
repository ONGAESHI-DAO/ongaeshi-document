Sponsors purchase ONGAESHI NFTs and lend them to talents, hoping the talent will grow and give back. Sponsors choose which talent to lend their NFTs to.

Talents aim to grow and give back to their supporters and society. They request ONGAESHI NFTs for learning opportunities, specifying support and return terms. Chosen by a sponsor, they record their progress on their SBT. After completing the support, they fulfill the return, which also affects their credit score.

Teachers provide learning and opportunity support as defined in an NFT. They also receive a share of the return when the supported talent grows and gives back to ONGAESHI.

These stakeholders fund the talentâ€™s return to ONGAESHI from outside the DAO, ensuring the NFT's value. For upskilling NFTs, enterprises might pay a hiring commission fee. For research NFTs, grants might provide a talent matching fee when the talent wins a scholarship.

GT Owners actively participate in ONGAESHI DAO governance, voting on the distribution of GT stored in the DAO treasury to fund public goods. Tokens can be earned by sponsors and teachers based on talent performance or purchased on the market.
